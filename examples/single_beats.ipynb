This will simulate a cardiac cycle using the built-in 4th-order Rung-Kutta solver using the initial conditions provided in the input file parameter `k`. After running one cardiac cycle, the solver checks if a steady-state circulation has been reached by comparing the differences between the initial and final blood volumes in all compartments. If these differences are below a certain threshold (default 1e-6), the model is considered to have converged. If the model has not converged, the solver will run another cardiac cycle with the final volumes set as the new initial conditions. The solver will continue to run cardiac cycles until the model has converged. The solver will also stop if the maximum number of iterations is reached (input file parameter `iter_max`). The solver will print the volume error in each compartment if the `print_solve` parameter is set to `True` (default `False`). The first time this code is executed, the function is much slower, because the python code has to be compiled first into machine code using Numba.

The ventricular composite geometry consists of three spherical walls based on the TriSeg method [3], and each wall can be split into a series of individual segments, or patches [3]. Each patch can be assigned a different activation timing through the `*`heart.t_act`*` parameter, where each value stands for a patch, and the wall each patch is located in is specified in `heart.patches`, where left free wall is 0, right wall is 1, septal wall is 2, left atrium is 3, and right atrium is 4. Not that the other cardiac parameters need to be set for each patch as well, which comes with pros and cons: each patch can be assigned different properties, but now each parameter requires a list of specified values equal to the number of patches.\n",

This input file is based on [1], note however the code version used for that paper included several differences, most notably no atria, so the results will be slightly different. Moreover, the results for that paper were generated using the original MATLAB version of this code, which is still publicly available on GitHub.
